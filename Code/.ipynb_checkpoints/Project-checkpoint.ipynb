      "I purchased an Uber gift card in the amount of $25.00 for my son to use. He tried to redeem it, however Uber asked him for a credit card which he does not have... Hence, me buying the Uber gift card for him. In an attempt to satisfy Uber's request, I purchased another gift card for $25.00 thinking this could act as the secondary. Instead the Uber app requested my son provide credit card info again. So, I finally caved and provided a credit card to my son as a back-up payment to satisfy Uber's request. They made such a mess in my account that the bank automatically shut my card down. First, Uber charges your account, then they reverse the charge, but this is done over 12 consecutive times causing alerts to my bank. Without knowing, my son at the time purchased another gift card while I had purchased the 2nd gift card listed above in the amount of $25.00 and of course, he cannot use that one either unless credit card information is inputted into the Uber app. This is dishonest business. How can this business sell gift cards if they are NOT going to properly redeem them?There are lots of consumers that do not have credit card, so the gift card is a good alternative. However, this is much more trouble than it is worth. Uber should NOT be allowed to sell gift cards. Can you imagine buying a gift card to the movies or a retail outlet and then being told they need your credit card information in order to redeem them? How does Uber get away with this business practice? This really causes undue stress to people such as myself who find themselves in this situation, as well as can place people into unwanted situation of proving credit card information.\n",

      "Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee.

      "75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had \"Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No\" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.3) Drivers often don't know the city, relying too much on GPS and so unaware of their surroundings. Taxi drivers seem to know the popular destinations and fastest/shortest way to get there depending on conditions, whereas Uber drivers usually are like little automatons, staring at GPS and unaware that Waze is sending us on an unnecessary 5-mile detour. I recently had a ride to the Broad Museum in downtown LA from my home which is 4 miles away. The driver never heard of it, and his GPS wasn't working.When I told him it was on Bunker Hill, next to Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Music Center, and near the County Courthouse he had never heard of any of them. Those are all iconic L.A. landmarks - nobody should be allowed to drive for Uber if they don't know the fundamental layout of the city and its landmarks. 4) The Uber App on my iPhone hogs too much memory. I have limited storage capacity on my phone and so had to review and remove some items. The Uber app, >150mb, was one of the biggest apps and so I removed it. By comparison, Lyft's app is only 74mb.\n",

      "Driving for Uber is depressing and not satisfying. I would say 20% to 30% of people are completely irrational and have unrealistic expectations. Driving rich, hollow, and entitled people in my car is not a joy. After making a small comment to a rider about living on a hill I was asked to turn up the radio immediately. I laughed at how rude the exchange was. I picked up a lady from a BMW dealership. She told me the dealership booked her a ride. She immediately told me she was not pleased with the car, that she likes nice cars even though the car is clean 2015 Honda Civic.The hours put into tolerating passengers, wasting gas, and depreciating your car's value is challenging. Many customers cancel even though you can drive to the destination and receive no compensation for the ride. Handing out candies and providing phone plugs for people in a minimum wage job is a bit excessive almost akin to sexual favors at a fast food restaurant. Basically, once the customer is in your car you have to absorb whatever excrement they spew to support their delicate ego. I would not advise anyone to do this job. The pay is ridiculous.

Trip 2 a short ride from my hotel was $20, when a yellow cab for the same trip was $8. The driver again stopped midway down the block and parked in front of another hotel. It took him 25 minutes to find me, when the APP showed his car making circles around the blocks nearby. Trip 3 the driver did not know where to go to find Broadway and Lafayette. Uber drivers use their personal cars to pick up a few fares. They don't know the normal taxi protocols, and it cost be double or more for each local ride.

      "Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's \"dynamic pricing\" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.The algorithms used by Uber are suspect. I live in a City that has contracted with Uber to provide local transportation free of charge...using a City vehicle. It took me 40 minutes to arrive at a destination that normally takes 5 minutes...picking up people along the way/dropping them off. I've shared my experience with the City, and they are aware of Uber's shortcomings...plan to address such with the company. Needless to say, Uber is struggling with the \"pool\" algorithms and has chosen to not work with its customers when inequities surface. Uber has lost a loyal customer!\n",

      "I had just completed running the New York Marathon and had requested an Uber Pool ride back to my hotel. First, let me tell you what started out right: The driver agreed to the pick up and drop off locations via the app. I then called and spoke with the driver to let him know that the pick up location was actually blocked off due to the marathon, and we agreed on another pickup location 1 block away before the race road block. Before I was picked up, I got a notification that another rider would be joining for part of my ride. I was picked up by the driver at the spoken agreed upon location; shortly the 2nd passenger was picked up and dropped off. Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.I asked my driver what was going and he claimed, \"Gee I don't, I have another passenger to pick up now and your ride is over so you need to get out now\". Still confused, I asked him again how my could be over when we were still far from my agreed upon destination? This time he clearly played dumb, saying over and over again that he doesn't understand how is Uber app works, and I had to get out. In the middle of the street, by myself, in a strange location that was not even anywhere on my route.Not wanting to argue, as it was clear that he had a new ride request for another that would clearly be more lucrative for him, and myself not wanting to continue the ride with this jerk, I peacefully exited the car where I stood in front of a private residence mid-town, shivering cold in the 50 degree, rainy weather, in the dark, having just completed running the 26.2 mile marathon and wanting nothing more than a safe ride back to the hotel to seek much needed rest, warmth and safety. No sooner than I exited the car, the driver was already scrawling his new fare's name of a piece of paper and standing outside his car, in the street, to meet his new fare, not once even having inkling of conscientiousness for what he had just done to me. And the driver still had the nerve to charge me $10 partial fare!!Not excited to be using the Uber app again, but not on a street where any taxis were coming by and not having another other apps installed (such as Lyft), I requested a new ride. I was connected shortly with another driver that was 10 minutes away. 10 minutes is not an very long amount of time, if you are warm and safe, but again, dressed in running clothes, weary, and expecting to be a in safe warm car, I was stranded on the street to pace, alone, to wait for this driver. Also, this being not on a main street, and traffic very heavy due to the marathon rode closures, the 10 minute wait for him to be able to get to me was realistic. To my eternal happiness, he arrived within 5 minutes, and delivered me safely and nicely to my hotel.The next day, finding the only way to file a complaint to Uber was via the app. I sent my complaint and within a couple hours was replied to with a wet blanket apology for the \"inconvenience\" and offered me a $5 credit of the $10 I was charged. To make this even worse, Uber credited the $5 towards another driver, one we had taken the day before!! I wrote back to have this corrected, to not harm the previous day's good driver's reputation or take from his well earned pay, and to preserve my good relationships with all the other good Uber drivers I have rode with.Uber than wrote back with a full credit of my $10 (better, but certainly not enough to make up for the dangerous situation this driver put me in), and no mention of any discipline for this driver. I told Uber I would never use them again and would use Lyft from now on. Although all my many, many Uber experiences over the past few years that I have had have been 5-star, this one bad apple ruined Uber forever with me.\n",

      "Booked a Uber ride at 6.09pm with driver \"I Dewa Made Satrya\" to pick up from Nikki Beach Club, after waiting at the front of the club for 10 mins it was clear he was not coming as his vehicle which was 1km away was not moving in our direction, but I was surprised when the app changed to being on the journey, a few minutes later it finished but I was charge 15,000 rah (of course you waste time and write to uber the they refund it, but why should loyal passengers need to go through such crap when it is clearly not their fault?)\n",
      "\n",
      "I then booked Uber again at 6.19pm, the same driver \"I Dewa Made Satrya\" accepted the booking but this time, he messages me on WhatsApp to tell me unless i pay cash he is not coming, so I try to change the payment method to cash but this is not allowed on the Uber app, so when I tell the driver this he says unless I pay him cash he will not come!!  He then asked me to cancel, but luckily it is within the 5 min BS time limit so I am not charged a cancellation fee this time (even though again it is not my fault!)\n",
      "\n",
      "I advised the driver \"I Dewa Made Satrya\" that the service is terrible, he told me he does not care and when I said I would report this service to Uber he said \"I do not fear\", clearly Uber does not care for passenger service and is happy to hire anyone in Bali as a driver, as I would never employee someone with such an attitude, especially when now 18 hours later he just sent me another offence message to my phone \"You Emang Top\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway avoid the driver \"I Dewa Made Satrya\"with phone number +62 821 4407 1347\n",

      "I then attempted to make another booking, this time it was picked up by driver \"Nyoman\", this booking was at now 6.29pm, this driver was 8 minutes away and started driving to my location, so I was thinking great finally have a driver, he was within about 3 minutes away and then I noticed he kept going passed the turn off and when I contacted him he said he is not coming, I could see on the app he was like 3 mins away, then 6 mins, 9 min, 12 min and clearly not coming to Nusa Dua but driving to Ulawatu, this driver just ignored all contact from me via message/phone, just keep driving and I guess waiting for me to cancel, which I finally did, clearly another driver that does not care for passenger service\n",
      "\n",
      "Please avoid \"Nyoman\" driver and his number is +62 812 3786 5029, he clearly does not care and should not be allowed to drive for Uber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok so finally made another booking with Uber, it is now 6.40pm, the guy turns up, very nice driver, but as I got into the car and sat down my daughter was just getting into the car and the driver starts to drive off, without her being in the car, the door was still open, my daughter then hit the road and was left on the street, this was clearly an accident but careless driving from Uber, I will not write his name, as he was nice, but clearly not careful.\n",

      "My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.\n",

Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee.

We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same.

When you factor in gas, wear and tear on your car, tires, brakes, etc. you are likely making about $5 per hour!

I want to just call them if I have an issue. It’s so frustrating. However, two things have happened in a short time that will make me be very wary in using Uber in the future. Might just go back to taking cabs.The first didn’t leave us feeling good about Uber but we let it go. My brother called an Uber to pick us up from the beach. The Uber driver arrived with an Uber and Lyft sign in his window. We didn’t get a good feeling about him from the outset. He dropped us off at our home as arranged. He accepted a cash tip (this was before you could tip on the Uber App.) Later Uber retroactively charged my brothers card for $50.00 because the driver reported we had gotten sand on his floor mats. He picked us up at the beach... My brother contacted Uber and said that even though it was ridiculous in the first place, the $50.00 charge was not in line with their own criteria on their website. They refused to refund anything. Period.Now today, I see an email from Uber in my inbox. \"You rode with Dario 4.17 miles. Trip Time 00:12:04 Car UberX,\" with the following message: \"Adjustment Care due to different drop off locations. Ricardo (whoever that is), Previous charge: $25.35. Charged Personal **: $233.58. New Total: $258.93.\" Plus I thought the driver was good and am a generous tipper in general so I also gave him a $10 tip through Uber.That is the most expensive 4 mile ride I have and will ever have taken. You can’t speak to a human and I get no email confirmation that my dispute has even been received. I have heard zero back. This is beyond horrifying. After now writing this I’m even more upset...\n",

      "My appointment time for auto repairs required a drop-off early am for it to be there and available for a mechanic to begin the work. The Uber app was easily installed on my mobile device and was followed with the required information being filled onto the blanks. When typing a phone number, it gave an order to check SMS texts for a confirmation code to be used along with the number. No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Uber headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. As follows; I suggest someone there unclog your ride summoning impacted website rectum by swallowing an online laxative, followed by a readily available Fleets enema from a pharmacy.I now must wait 1 1/2 weeks to have repairs done from being a no-show at the shop. That means safety concerns to drive as is. When using Uber once 9 months past, things went far better and a problem cleared up pronto by an apologetic and most courteous driver. What a letdown on this go round. If the world's greatest ability is dependability, why then are public service companies not aware of and learning such an important aspect of the business world? This incident is a second of its kind with the same problem and still no fix. Then, unlike now, I had made contact with their home base, only to be treated rudely and with great disrespect. Perhaps a reply is better not forthcoming after all. I at least have a choice of 4 codes and might need one to request service 12 hours ahead of when it is needed.

Before I was picked up, I got a notification that another rider would be joining for part of my ride. I was picked up by the driver at the spoken agreed upon location; shortly the 2nd passenger was picked up and dropped off. Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.I asked my driver what was going and he claimed, \"Gee I don't, I have another passenger to pick up now and your ride is over so you need to get out now\". Still confused, I asked him again how my could be over when we were still far from my agreed upon destination? This time he clearly played dumb, saying over and over again that he doesn't understand how is Uber app works, and I had to get out. In the middle of the street, by myself, in a strange location that was not even anywhere on my route.Not wanting to argue, as it was clear that he had a new ride request for another that would clearly be more lucrative for him, and myself not wanting to continue the ride with this jerk, I peacefully exited the car where I stood in front of a private residence mid-town, shivering cold in the 50 degree, rainy weather, in the dark, having just completed running the 26.2 mile marathon and wanting nothing more than a safe ride back to the hotel to seek much needed rest, warmth and safety. No sooner than I exited the car, the driver was already scrawling his new fare's name of a piece of paper and standing outside his car, in the street, to meet his new fare, not once even having inkling of conscientiousness for what he had just done to me. And the driver still had the nerve to charge me $10 partial fare!!Not excited to be using the Uber app again, but not on a street where any taxis were coming by and not having another other apps installed (such as Lyft), I requested a new ride. I was connected shortly with another driver that was 10 minutes away. 10 minutes is not an very long amount of time, if you are warm and safe, but again, dressed in running clothes, weary, and expecting to be a in safe warm car, I was stranded on the street to pace, alone, to wait for this driver. Also, this being not on a main street, and traffic very heavy due to the marathon rode closures, the 10 minute wait for him to be able to get to me was realistic. To my eternal happiness, he arrived within 5 minutes, and delivered me safely and nicely to my hotel.The next day, finding the only way to file a complaint to Uber was via the app. I sent my complaint and within a couple hours was replied to with a wet blanket apology for the \"inconvenience\" and offered me a $5 credit of the $10 I was charged. To make this even worse, Uber credited the $5 towards another driver, one we had taken the day before!! I wrote back to have this corrected, to not harm the previous day's good driver's reputation or take from his well earned pay, and to preserve my good relationships with all the other good Uber drivers I have rode with.Uber than wrote back with a full credit of my $10 (better, but certainly not enough to make up for the dangerous situation this driver put me in), and no mention of any discipline for this driver. I told Uber I would never use them again and would use Lyft from now on. Although all my many, many Uber experiences over the past few years that I have had have been 5-star, this one bad apple ruined Uber forever with me.\n",

      "Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives.\n",

      "For myself Uber has been a pleasant surprise. After reading through a hundred plus reviews and watching a few YouTube related videos(hysterical). I found myself uncertain if I wanted to join the Uber Brigade. The reviews seemed for the most part, to be negative. Not enough pay, a lot of down time etc. For myself, Everytime I flip on the Uber app it's non stop, until I stop. However I live in Toronto and I only use it part time. I have a full time gig. If I work Uber its 2 to 4 hrs a night Monday to Thursday at \"rush hour\".Friday I go 5pm until 10pm and start back up at 2-2:30am and work for a few more hours. Saturday repeat and Sunday is always busy up until 4pm. The rate varies for me but I base it by the day. It's been as low as $18 an hour and as high as $35 an hr. I don't always work the best times but I'm still averaging $21 an hr. After my first month. If you work the right times you can make $25-35 an hour, for me a perfect effortless part time job. The people are great. I always offer water and candy.  Anyway if you're reading this and contemplating just check it out what do you have to lose. Here's my reference number you'll receive a minimum $50 incentive after your first 10 rides. Or at least that's what my incentive was. I believe it varies by city but anyone can use it https://partners.uber.com/join/?city=Toronto&invite_code=nqrh6fgpue\n",

      "My daughter, a college student went out and had expected her ride to be $37.00 home as it had been in the past. As a result of you \"price surge policy\" she was charged $160.00! It was 1 am, pouring rain so she had no other options at that point or she would not have used Uber. The thing is, she and her friend never expected it to cost so much, and like so many other peopIe are stuck, desperate and are open to being gouged and taken advantage of. I have used uber as well for over a year and a half. My boyfriend also registered to become a driver but decided not to follow through. I am sad to say I disagree with your surge policy. I can understand a \"surcharge\"--even doubling the fare but this was unreasonable. \n",
      "Needless to say, I will no longer continue to use your service and will in the future advise all of my clients (I own a hair salon and spa) not to use uber. I have spoke highly of your service in the past but can't continue to give a good or even fair review.\n",

      "Heres the way to look at Uber from a different perspective. I live in Newport Beach California, I get up about 5:00 am and hit the road.  Trips to the airport are common this time of the morning.  LAX trips at least 5 times a week. Before 9:00 am i have made around 50.00 Take a break until I feel like it. Drive mid to late afternoon in by 8:30 pm I just made 120.00\n",

      "I average 700.00 a week x 4 equals 2800.00  Nice little addition to my V.A. disability. You have to run this as a business. You dont drive you dont get paid period end of story. If you have problems with the navigation how about changing what your using. Waze is awesome with the Uber app. \n",
      "I don't see how anyone can consider this as being an employee. I work when I want to. I take off for vacation when I want to. No one is in charge of me to tell me when  to drive or where to drive. And for those of you who complain about the maintenance on your car. Well, You should be keeping the maintenance on it any way. No wonder most of you got engine trouble. Using your car while working is a huge tax advantage.  Oh insurance.... You are required by law to have that any way. A little extra coverage may be required but to me its worth it. \n",

      "Some drivers have bad experiences with  driving for Uber. If you drive in a bad area guess what you gonna get bad riders. But alas!  You have control of who gets in your car. Boot em out. Say thanks but no thanks and go on about our business. I drive in a very good area and in business areas. On occasion i get a really stupid jerk wagon. Guess what?  He no ride with me.

      "Do not lose anything in Uber otherwise your experience will be a nightmare getting them to recognize you. My friend had the ride set up however at the end of the trip I got dropped off leaving my wallet in the black leather seats, black wallet at night. Anyhow, my friend needed to provide verification about her account, no problem, except around 40 emails and 2 days later they didn't accept the email address from her account she provided at signing nor her phone number that she was calling from that she used for this ride. It was uselessness forwarding this info to them even as they weren't confirming her own or my accounts.

      "My appointment time for auto repairs required a drop-off early am for it to be there and available for a mechanic to begin the work. The Uber app was easily installed on my mobile device and was followed with the required information being filled onto the blanks. When typing a phone number, it gave an order to check SMS texts for a confirmation code to be used along with the number. No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Uber headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. As follows; I suggest someone there unclog your ride summoning impacted website rectum by swallowing an online laxative, followed by a readily available Fleets enema from a pharmacy.I now must wait 1 1/2 weeks to have repairs done from being a no-show at the shop. That means safety concerns to drive as is. When using Uber once 9 months past, things went far better and a problem cleared up pronto by an apologetic and most courteous driver. What a letdown on this go round. If the world's greatest ability is dependability, why then are public service companies not aware of and learning such an important aspect of the business world? This incident is a second of its kind with the same problem and still no fix. Then, unlike now, I had made contact with their home base, only to be treated rudely and with great disrespect. Perhaps a reply is better not forthcoming after all. I at least have a choice of 4 codes and might need one to request service 12 hours ahead of when it is needed. Uber folks, you had oughta uncrimp the do-do contained in the app from the Google store.\n",

      "I use Uber fairly frequently. Overall it has been a good service. I’ve had amazing drivers. You cannot call them. Only go through some steps to send them messages. I want to just call them if I have an issue. It’s so frustrating. However, two things have happened in a short time that will make me be very wary in using Uber in the future. Might just go back to taking cabs.The first didn’t leave us feeling good about Uber but we let it go. My brother called an Uber to pick us up from the beach. The Uber driver arrived with an Uber and Lyft sign in his window. We didn’t get a good feeling about him from the outset. He dropped us off at our home as arranged. He accepted a cash tip (this was before you could tip on the Uber App.) Later Uber retroactively charged my brothers card for $50.00 because the driver reported we had gotten sand on his floor mats. He picked us up at the beach... My brother contacted Uber and said that even though it was ridiculous in the first place, the $50.00 charge was not in line with their own criteria on their website. They refused to refund anything. Period.Now today, I see an email from Uber in my inbox. \"You rode with Dario 4.17 miles. Trip Time 00:12:04 Car UberX,\" with the following message: \"Adjustment Care due to different drop off locations. Ricardo (whoever that is), Previous charge: $25.35. Charged Personal **: $233.58. New Total: $258.93.\" Plus I thought the driver was good and am a generous tipper in general so I also gave him a $10 tip through Uber.That is the most expensive 4 mile ride I have and will ever have taken. You can’t speak to a human and I get no email confirmation that my dispute has even been received. I have heard zero back. This is beyond horrifying. After now writing this I’m even more upset...\n",

      "Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's \"dynamic pricing\" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.The algorithms used by Uber are suspect. I live in a City that has contracted with Uber to provide local transportation free of charge...using a City vehicle. It took me 40 minutes to arrive at a destination that normally takes 5 minutes...picking up people along the way/dropping them off. I've shared my experience with the City, and they are aware of Uber's shortcomings...plan to address such with the company. Needless to say, Uber is struggling with the \"pool\" algorithms and has chosen to not work with its customers when inequities surface. Uber has lost a loyal customer!\n",

      "I drive for Uber in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I keep my car clean, inside and out, and often receive compliments on cleanliness. Uber drivers cannot be called from a time of more than 15 minutes from the pick up point, unless there is no other driver in the area. I have been called at 16 minutes without surge pricing. Speaking about pricing, in the Milwaukee area, the minimum charge is currently $5.25 (Uber X), of which the driver receives $3.20. The rate is based on $1.20/mile and $0.20/ minute (Uber X). Passengers often call Uber X when they should be calling an XL, but are rarely turned away. This does not give them a right to complain on that part. Customers are given estimates of the cost, as long as they put in the destination, and are notified if it is surging. They are allowed to cancel at any time, even after I arrive, without penalty. Fares can vary based on route taken, construction delays, accidents, and other traffic delays. I  end the trip immediately, as per Uber policy, when I mess up on the route, get stuck in traffic, or if the customer gets upset because of the trip. The customer is my number one priority, and I treat every passenger the way I would want them to treat me. The large part of my ridership is intoxicated college students, and they often get rowdy in my car. It takes alot of patience, which gets trying, to keep professional. If this doesn't sound like a job for you, please, don't apply to drive. I agree that there are problems with Uber, most freqently is due to GPS location with dropped pins. I suggest to manually enter your location of pick up and drop off, and contact your driver as soon as you get a conformation and verify your location. I notify all my passengers, when I arrive, of the address I am at to confirm my location is where they want me. For passengers, if you are expecting an Uber to arrive, please be ready, look for a message, and respond promptly. Drivers are paid per completed trip, not per hour, and do not make money sitting and waiting. Which is why I only wait 5 minutes after I arrive, unless the customer contacts me, responds to my message, or asks me to wait. I often get into a surging area, for pick up, and have to wait for a customer who never shows or cancels after I have been waiting. This is upsetting because I could be out picking up an actual person who needs my service. Drivers do not know where your destination is until he starts the trip, so we cannot decline to take you anywhere until we have already started the trip, after which we are committed to following through because the app does not allow us to cancel a trip in progress. I have never turned away a customer based on destination, nor for them needing my trunk space. I have picked up customers from grocery stores and helped them with their groceries, even carried them inside for them. I have picked up people for the airport and loaded and unloaded their luggage, and wished them a safe trip! In Milwaukee, Uber does not have privileges to pick up at Mitchell International Airport, or at least Uber X's. I often make trips from the downtown area to Waukesha, New Berlin, Greenfield, Grafton, Oak Creek, and Pewaukee. These fares are typically between $13 to $26 on non-surge rates. Those trips are between 15 and 25 minutes one way. My take on these trips average out to about a dollar per mile and Uber takes the rest.\n",

      "There are several things that annoy me about the Uber service in the Boston, MA area. (1) You cannot cancel an ordered drive when it becomes apparent that the driver of the car cannot seem to find where you are at despite phone calls and having past your drive area two to three times without having to pay for the cancellation because of the driver's outright ineptness. If I can track them as they pass by three times, so can The Uber network. It should be three times and you are out, period.(2) I was on a ride this evening where the driver could not find where we were even though we say their car go by twice. The GPS kept telling her where to turn and she kept missing the turns. And this was more than likely because the driver had the radio up loud playing hip-hop music and they were just plain not paying attention despite the fact that we had to tell the driver where to go. So much for the Quiet, Clean, and Courteous rides. (3) On an average from the same spot that I normally have to catch a cab, Uber, or Lyft from, it takes 15 to 30 minutes for the drivers to show up. My experience with Lyfts is that they are usually there before I get out of the door of the building and in worse conditions, never have to wait more that 5 minutes max. (4) Many Uber drivers are also or have been taxi drivers, so you get taken for a ride either way. My complaint is a general one because I am getting fed up with poor service from those that brag that theirs is better than any other. Clearly it is not. At least not in Boston.\n",

SERIOUSLY?! Now if these checks were, in fact, being done, then why the battle for not allowing drivers to be fingerprinted? It's an honest question, and quite frankly, a legit one. You claim your drivers are safe, but are unwilling to back that up with something so simple as fingerprinting?! LET THE BUYER BEWARE! 2nd point, GRATUITY. You tell the public that gratuity is included, and is not necessary. Okay, fine, but if a rider wishes to give a little extra to a driver for going that extra mile (no pun intended), you insist to the driver to NOT ACCEPT. First off people, the BIG CLUE here would be in THEIR WORDS, \"TIPPING IS INCLUDED.\" How can you 'include' something that the rider may or may not even want to do, let alone a price that would be set by someone other than themselves.Secondly, I'm quite sure there is some sort of legality here, because how can you justify doing this without allowing the rider the option of opting out of said \"included tip.\" Kind of how you can do this at restaurants... which by the way are usually parties of 8 or more. And thirdly, why, on the itemized receipts, was there no listing of what said gratuity was? It listed everything else from, how long the trip was, to what the surge pricing was (if applicable) but not that. It's because, yet again, Uber not only lied to its riders but simultaneously screwed its rideshare partners. It's because it NEVER WAS INCLUDED. In fact, just recently, Uber settled a $100 million lawsuit on this very subject, and STILL refuses to add a spot on the app for a gratuity option for riders. 3rd point, INCENTIVES. This will be short, because there aren't any. No real motivation for any driver, anywhere, to give their VERY BEST. For me, giving my best was easy, because I wanted to regardless of the circumstances. However, with others, that's the only reason to do so. And it's because of that, that I would hear story, after story, about how my riders \"last\" experience was so horrible which makes me look bad too.And finally my 4th point, EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. Uber Partners get 1099'd, use their own car, pay their own fuel, clean their own cars, pay for their own repairs which clearly indicates INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, but when you start NOT accepting rides you get bombarded with cute emails warning you of deactivation, clearly indicating EMPLOYEE. How can you dictate what I can and cannot take, and still call us INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS?! The answer is you can't. Which is why I have taken my natural gifts, as a decent human being, and have been GIVING MY ALL to Lyft. Lyft is a WAY better company to work for. They offer incentives to drivers and riders alike. They do a more thorough background check on drivers (the evidence of this one is simply not every Uber Partner can become a Lyft Partner, even though both do independent background checks. Interesting huh. Not everyone knows that), and even rider and driver support is actually personable. Not to mention, when was the last time you heard ANY negative situation on the news about a Lyft driver? I have yet to hear one. All in all, Lyft maybe the smaller of the 2, but they are growing, and growing the SMART way considering QUALITY over QUANTITY. Sure Lyft, at times, maybe SLIGHTLY more but consider the QUALITY you will be getting. To all the readers of this post, PLEASE consider the switch to Lyft, if you haven't already. Don't let MINIMAL PRICE DIFFERENCE be the deciding factor when choosing a mode of transportation that you expect to get you and your loved ones around. Thank you for reading and be safe out there. --Dedicated Lyft Partner\n",

      "75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had \"Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No\" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.3) Drivers often don't know the city, relying too much on GPS and so unaware of their surroundings. Taxi drivers seem to know the popular destinations and fastest/shortest way to get there depending on conditions, whereas Uber drivers usually are like little automatons, staring at GPS and unaware that Waze is sending us on an unnecessary 5-mile detour. I recently had a ride to the Broad Museum in downtown LA from my home which is 4 miles away. The driver never heard of it, and his GPS wasn't working.When I told him it was on Bunker Hill, next to Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Music Center, and near the County Courthouse he had never heard of any of them. Those are all iconic L.A. landmarks - nobody should be allowed to drive for Uber if they don't know the fundamental layout of the city and its landmarks. 4) The Uber App on my iPhone hogs too much memory. I have limited storage capacity on my phone and so had to review and remove some items. The Uber app, >150mb, was one of the biggest apps and so I removed it. By comparison, Lyft's app is only 74mb.\n",

      "I had just completed running the New York Marathon and had requested an Uber Pool ride back to my hotel. First, let me tell you what started out right: The driver agreed to the pick up and drop off locations via the app. I then called and spoke with the driver to let him know that the pick up location was actually blocked off due to the marathon, and we agreed on another pickup location 1 block away before the race road block. Before I was picked up, I got a notification that another rider would be joining for part of my ride. I was picked up by the driver at the spoken agreed upon location; shortly the 2nd passenger was picked up and dropped off. Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.I asked my driver what was going and he claimed, \"Gee I don't, I have another passenger to pick up now and your ride is over so you need to get out now\". Still confused, I asked him again how my could be over when we were still far from my agreed upon destination? This time he clearly played dumb, saying over and over again that he doesn't understand how is Uber app works, and I had to get out. In the middle of the street, by myself, in a strange location that was not even anywhere on my route.Not wanting to argue, as it was clear that he had a new ride request for another that would clearly be more lucrative for him, and myself not wanting to continue the ride with this jerk, I peacefully exited the car where I stood in front of a private residence mid-town, shivering cold in the 50 degree, rainy weather, in the dark, having just completed running the 26.2 mile marathon and wanting nothing more than a safe ride back to the hotel to seek much needed rest, warmth and safety. No sooner than I exited the car, the driver was already scrawling his new fare's name of a piece of paper and standing outside his car, in the street, to meet his new fare, not once even having inkling of conscientiousness for what he had just done to me. And the driver still had the nerve to charge me $10 partial fare!!Not excited to be using the Uber app again, but not on a street where any taxis were coming by and not having another other apps installed (such as Lyft), I requested a new ride. I was connected shortly with another driver that was 10 minutes away. 10 minutes is not an very long amount of time, if you are warm and safe, but again, dressed in running clothes, weary, and expecting to be a in safe warm car, I was stranded on the street to pace, alone, to wait for this driver. Also, this being not on a main street, and traffic very heavy due to the marathon rode closures, the 10 minute wait for him to be able to get to me was realistic. To my eternal happiness, he arrived within 5 minutes, and delivered me safely and nicely to my hotel.The next day, finding the only way to file a complaint to Uber was via the app. I sent my complaint and within a couple hours was replied to with a wet blanket apology for the \"inconvenience\" and offered me a $5 credit of the $10 I was charged. To make this even worse, Uber credited the $5 towards another driver, one we had taken the day before!! I wrote back to have this corrected, to not harm the previous day's good driver's reputation or take from his well earned pay, and to preserve my good relationships with all the other good Uber drivers I have rode with.Uber than wrote back with a full credit of my $10 (better, but certainly not enough to make up for the dangerous situation this driver put me in), and no mention of any discipline for this driver. I told Uber I would never use them again and would use Lyft from now on. Although all my many, many Uber experiences over the past few years that I have had have been 5-star, this one bad apple ruined Uber forever with me.\n",

Until the next day when I see my receipt not only did my heart stopped seeing how much I got charged 194 dollars plus the ten from the other driver, I was soo angry and the time on the receipt said 2:00 to 5:00 am so this guy didn't turn off his uber, he probably thought she's drunk she won't notice..well I was trying to fight for this because what this guy is a scam like I get it we all need money but too step this low to get money is not correct. Soo after a few messages with uber there only going to give me $100 back but I am still going getting charged $86 like wtf that's still too much and after being super angry and what that driver did I don't want too pay anything..I don't think I'll be using uber anymore shady money hungry people.\n",

      "Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's \"dynamic pricing\" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.The algorithms used by Uber are suspect. I live in a City that has contracted with Uber to provide local transportation free of charge...using a City vehicle. It took me 40 minutes to arrive at a destination that normally takes 5 minutes...picking up people along the way/dropping them off. I've shared my experience with the City, and they are aware of Uber's shortcomings...plan to address such with the company. Needless to say, Uber is struggling with the \"pool\" algorithms and has chosen to not work with its customers when inequities surface. Uber has lost a loyal customer!\n",

It was uselessness forwarding this info to them even as they weren't confirming her own or my accounts. It's mind boggling how the messages we were getting back were not recognizing the very content info we used for the ride. Not sure where their tech support is in terms of usability.

      "If I could give 0 stars I would. Uber has STOLE my MONEY and has made 3 unauthorized charges to my credit card. On top of that, they are not even taking responsibility for it and continuously keep marking my issue as resolved even though I have proof such as my bank statements. There is no phone number or place I could go therefore they are taking advantage of that. There are random charges on my credit card that total to over $30 and I did not use my Uber app for a few weeks. When I asked them to explain those charges they say they don't know and just ignore me and mark it as resolved. Also, just recently, I had to wait for 3.5 hours to have my food delivered through UberEATS, I called UberEATS and complained and all they said they can do is give me a 50% refund, and you know what? They DIDN’T give me that either! I have already called UberEATS 7 times now and they keep saying they will process it but they never end up doing it. As soon as I find a lawyer I am suing UBER for lying, for making unauthorized charges to my credit card, and more. It is ILLEGAL, federal crime to steal money.\n",

      "If you are contemplating driving for Uber in NJ, think again....maybe 3x. Ask around. All I know from my experience as a driver for three months with 500 trips under my belt and a 4.8 rating........be very very circumspect before leasing a car. What they do is rope you in as a driver with decent pay for two weeks....then wham.....they cut the fares in half. Let me ask you as a logical human being......can a driver who has usually a car payment of at least $600 per month...plus insurance.....(unless the ins. co finds out you drive for Uber and then presto....drops you like a rusty safe in the river) plus gas, and wear and tear on the car driver 10-15 minutes for $3....well that is the fare they pay. Also if you happen to drive to Manhattan......and they take out $20 for toll and charge the customer.....and then only pay you $8-15 on top of that to drop off the customer before you have to drive through traffic to get back into NJ to accept another fare which usually takes at least an hour....do you think that is a good usage of time and good pay? You see what Uber is doing is trying to show Wall Street (Watch \"The Big Short\"- very appropo for Uber) the huge rider base. The problem is that the drivers are dropping out like flies because they can not afford to drive. I know as I have picked up many ex drivers recounting the same experience. Wall St......which incidentally I used to work for years ago for almost two decades.....is about to have a rude awakening when they see the market valuation Uber claims of $63 bill. -even though they lost over $467 mill in 2015-from a confidential source yours truly picked up devulged-is nothing more than specious and a \"house of cards\". Now Uber's PR will tell you how wonderful it is to slash fares all in order to be more busy for the drivers but don't believe a word they say. It is because they are burning through drivers faster than the INDIE speedway all in order to keep riders happy. Good luck people in your decision but know that you had better do your homework before you get involved in such an exploitive outfit. BE DAMN CAREFUL.\n",

      "Unfortunately I don't have a car at the moment and I started using uber and it was great but I noticed now that everyone is doing uber it has gone downhil. Example when your driver arrives and doesn't see you, they don't try to drive again to see if they find the passenger, they cancel and get $10 or $5 not fair at all.  Okay so this Friday I went to an event in downtown and I decided to take uber home because I was tired thinking this would be a good idea.  First driver passes by me I am waving and he cancels I get charged $10. I should of just taken the bus but I order a second one, he sees me right away and he drives. Well I wasn't drunk just super buzzed.. I notice this guy is taking a diffrent route like way off and he got off far from where my address was and was driving so slow but I don't say anything. Until the next day when I see my receipt not only did my heart stopped seeing how much I got charged 194 dollars plus the ten from the other driver, I was soo angry and the time on the receipt said 2:00 to 5:00 am so this guy didn't turn off his uber, he probably thought she's drunk she won't notice..well I was trying to fight for this because what this guy is a scam like I get it we all need money but too step this low to get money is not correct. Soo after a few messages with uber there only going to give me $100 back but I am still going getting charged $86 like wtf that's still too much and after being super angry and what that driver did I don't want too pay anything..I don't think I'll be using uber anymore shady money hungry people.\n",

      "I had a Uber driver pick me up at a restaurant in Chicago and requested a ride to hotel, only 2 miles away. Since I was a tourist I had no idea how to get to my hotel and neither did my driver. He didn't know English or how to use MapQuest. He drove around for 20 minutes in a circle. I had to get on my iPhone and give him the instructions to get to Chicago O'hare Sheraton. And since he got lost, I got charged $30!!! On paper, Uber sounds like a good idea, but in reality it doesn't work. The drivers are not trained well, their cars are dirty, they are just jumping from fare to fare without any regard to the customers. Uber is a hot mess.\n",

      "Our party of 6 consisted of three of my adult daughters and two friends going wedding dress shopping. We needed an SUV to accommodate all of us, and Uber showed a driver 20 minutes away in Sanford, Florida. Perfect, we thought as the reservation wasn't for another 40 minutes. We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment. There must be a way for Uber to assure that your card is being used for YOUR trip and not for someone else.\n",

      "I had just completed running the New York Marathon and had requested an Uber Pool ride back to my hotel. First, let me tell you what started out right: The driver agreed to the pick up and drop off locations via the app. I then called and spoke with the driver to let him know that the pick up location was actually blocked off due to the marathon, and we agreed on another pickup location 1 block away before the race road block. Before I was picked up, I got a notification that another rider would be joining for part of my ride. I was picked up by the driver at the spoken agreed upon location; shortly the 2nd passenger was picked up and dropped off. Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.I asked my driver what was going and he claimed, \"Gee I don't, I have another passenger to pick up now and your ride is over so you need to get out now\". Still confused, I asked him again how my could be over when we were still far from my agreed upon destination? This time he clearly played dumb, saying over and over again that he doesn't understand how is Uber app works, and I had to get out. In the middle of the street, by myself, in a strange location that was not even anywhere on my route.Not wanting to argue, as it was clear that he had a new ride request for another that would clearly be more lucrative for him, and myself not wanting to continue the ride with this jerk, I peacefully exited the car where I stood in front of a private residence mid-town, shivering cold in the 50 degree, rainy weather, in the dark, having just completed running the 26.2 mile marathon and wanting nothing more than a safe ride back to the hotel to seek much needed rest, warmth and safety. No sooner than I exited the car, the driver was already scrawling his new fare's name of a piece of paper and standing outside his car, in the street, to meet his new fare, not once even having inkling of conscientiousness for what he had just done to me. And the driver still had the nerve to charge me $10 partial fare!!Not excited to be using the Uber app again, but not on a street where any taxis were coming by and not having another other apps installed (such as Lyft), I requested a new ride. I was connected shortly with another driver that was 10 minutes away. 10 minutes is not an very long amount of time, if you are warm and safe, but again, dressed in running clothes, weary, and expecting to be a in safe warm car, I was stranded on the street to pace, alone, to wait for this driver. Also, this being not on a main street, and traffic very heavy due to the marathon rode closures, the 10 minute wait for him to be able to get to me was realistic. To my eternal happiness, he arrived within 5 minutes, and delivered me safely and nicely to my hotel.The next day, finding the only way to file a complaint to Uber was via the app. I sent my complaint and within a couple hours was replied to with a wet blanket apology for the \"inconvenience\" and offered me a $5 credit of the $10 I was charged. To make this even worse, Uber credited the $5 towards another driver, one we had taken the day before!! I wrote back to have this corrected, to not harm the previous day's good driver's reputation or take from his well earned pay, and to preserve my good relationships with all the other good Uber drivers I have rode with.Uber than wrote back with a full credit of my $10 (better, but certainly not enough to make up for the dangerous situation this driver put me in), and no mention of any discipline for this driver. I told Uber I would never use them again and would use Lyft from now on. Although all my many, many Uber experiences over the past few years that I have had have been 5-star, this one bad apple ruined Uber forever with me.\n",

      "My appointment time for auto repairs required a drop-off early am for it to be there and available for a mechanic to begin the work. The Uber app was easily installed on my mobile device and was followed with the required information being filled onto the blanks. When typing a phone number, it gave an order to check SMS texts for a confirmation code to be used along with the number. No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Uber headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. As follows; I suggest someone there unclog your ride summoning impacted website rectum by swallowing an online laxative, followed by a readily available Fleets enema from a pharmacy.I now must wait 1 1/2 weeks to have repairs done from being a no-show at the shop. That means safety concerns to drive as is. When using Uber once 9 months past, things went far better and a problem cleared up pronto by an apologetic and most courteous driver. What a letdown on this go round. If the world's greatest ability is dependability, why then are public service companies not aware of and learning such an important aspect of the business world? This incident is a second of its kind with the same problem and still no fix. Then, unlike now, I had made contact with their home base, only to be treated rudely and with great disrespect. Perhaps a reply is better not forthcoming after all. I at least have a choice of 4 codes and might need one to request service 12 hours ahead of when it is needed. Uber folks, you had oughta uncrimp the do-do contained in the app from the Google store.\n",

      "I use Uber fairly frequently. Overall it has been a good service. I’ve had amazing drivers. You cannot call them. Only go through some steps to send them messages. I want to just call them if I have an issue. It’s so frustrating. However, two things have happened in a short time that will make me be very wary in using Uber in the future. Might just go back to taking cabs.The first didn’t leave us feeling good about Uber but we let it go. My brother called an Uber to pick us up from the beach. The Uber driver arrived with an Uber and Lyft sign in his window. We didn’t get a good feeling about him from the outset. He dropped us off at our home as arranged. He accepted a cash tip (this was before you could tip on the Uber App.) Later Uber retroactively charged my brothers card for $50.00 because the driver reported we had gotten sand on his floor mats. He picked us up at the beach... My brother contacted Uber and said that even though it was ridiculous in the first place, the $50.00 charge was not in line with their own criteria on their website. They refused to refund anything. Period.Now today, I see an email from Uber in my inbox. \"You rode with Dario 4.17 miles. Trip Time 00:12:04 Car UberX,\" with the following message: \"Adjustment Care due to different drop off locations. Ricardo (whoever that is), Previous charge: $25.35. Charged Personal **: $233.58. New Total: $258.93.\" Plus I thought the driver was good and am a generous tipper in general so I also gave him a $10 tip through Uber.That is the most expensive 4 mile ride I have and will ever have taken. You can’t speak to a human and I get no email confirmation that my dispute has even been received. I have heard zero back. This is beyond horrifying. After now writing this I’m even more upset...\n",
